https://github.com/alphapapa/org-super-agenda/blob/master/examples.org This
package lets you “supercharge” your Org daily/weekly agenda. The idea is to
group items into sections, rather than having them all in one big list.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package "org-super-agenda"
      :ensure t
      :init
      (org-super-agenda-mode)

      (setq org-super-agenda-groups
	`(;; Each group has an implicit boolean OR operator between its selectors.
	 (:name "Today"  ; Optionally specify section name
		:time-grid t  ; Items that appear on the time grid
		:deadline "today"  ; Items that have a deadline today
	        :todo nil     ; Match any non-todo items
		:order 0
		)
	 (:name "Important"
		:priority>= "C"  ;; Any priority greater than C
		:order 1
		)
     ;; Position 2 -> Personalized 'org-super-agenda-private config inserted here
	 (:name "Blocked"
		:children todo ;; Items that have todo children
		:order 100
		)
	 (:name "Repeating Tasks"
		:regexp ,org-repeat-re  ;; Items that contain a repeating timestamp
		:regexp "<%%\(.*\)>"      ;; Items that contain a s-exp
		:order 98
		)
	 (:priority< "C"
		      ;; Show this section after "Today" and "Important", because
		      ;; their order is unspecified, defaulting to 0. Sections
		      ;; are displayed lowest-number-first.
		      :order 2)
	 ;; After the last group, the agenda will display items that didn't
	 ;; match any of these groups, with the default order position of 99
	 ))
      )

Example inserting groups into the middle of the list.
  #+begin_example emacs-lisp
  (let ((pos 2))  ;; Set position
  (dolist (x (reverse newgroups) oldgroups)
  (push x (nthcdr pos org-super-agenda-groups)))) ;; Insert position at list
  #+end_example
