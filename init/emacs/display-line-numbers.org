* Display line numbers
  Use =M-x display-line-numbers-mode= to toggle manually.

** Customization notes
  Can be set it using the customization menu ([[help:display-line-numbers]]);
  however this can have an undesirable effect of enabling line-numbers in
  buffers which may not work nicely with them (i.e. minimap).

** Only enable line numbers for buffers with associated files
   =auto-minor-mode-alist= only associates modes with specific files.
   Use a "\\." to match any file with a dot in it's file path.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (rjh/use "emacs/files:init") ;; Use auto-minor-mode-alist definition from here

    ;; Match any file with a "." in the filename
    (setq auto-minor-mode-alist
	    (append
	     (list
	       '("\\." . display-line-numbers-mode)
	       )
	     auto-minor-mode-alist))
  #+end_src
