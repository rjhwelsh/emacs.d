Most undo systems work linearly, tracking only undo/redo. 
This package works with the Emacs undo system, which tracks a branching set of changes. 

By default =C-/= will undo.
Now =C-S-/= will redo.
=C-x u= will provide a visual undo tree which can be navigated with the arrow
keys. Type =q= to exit.

See [[http://pragmaticemacs.com/emacs/advanced-undoredo-with-undo-tree/][here]] for examples.
