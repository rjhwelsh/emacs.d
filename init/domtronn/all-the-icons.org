** Installing fonts..
 In order for the icons to work it is very important that you install the
 Resource Fonts included in this package, they are available in the fonts
 directory. You can also install the latest fonts for this package in the
 (guessed?) based on the OS by calling the following function;

 #+begin_example emacs
 M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts
 #+end_example

 Bear in mind, this will also run fc-cache -f -v on MacOS and Linux which can
 take some time to complete. For Windows, this function will prompt for a
 download directory for you to install them manually.
