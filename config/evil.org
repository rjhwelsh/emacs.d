* Evil-mode
I originally came from vim, and this helped me gain some familiarity
with emacs before going head over heels. I eventually commented it out
so that I could focus on improving my emacs ability.

I only ever used evil, Out-Of-The-Box.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
			(use-package evil :ensure t
			:init
			(require 'evil)
			(evil-mode t)
				)
#+END_SRC
