* About
Brief note.
Irony is faster, and rtags is more feature-complete.

irony-mode is an Emacs minor-mode that aims at improving the editing experience
for the C, C++ and Objective-C languages. It works by using a combination of an
Emacs package and a C++ program (irony-server) exposing =libclang=.

For complete installation details please see https://github.com/Sarcasm/irony-mode#installation

* Irony project setup
Setup is similar to rtags.org (RTag).
See [[./rtags.org::Setup][rtags.org]] or [[https://github.com/Sarcasm/irony-mode#compilation-database][Compilation Databases]] for more details.

A compilation database (compile_commands.json) is required.
See Sarcasm's notes on the [[https://sarcasm.github.io/notes/dev/compilation-database.html][Compilation Database]] for extensive documentation on
what this is, and why it is important.

** cmake
 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1 .
