* About
This configuration is for setting up latex for emacs.

* Initialize

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq TeX-PDF-mode t)
#+END_SRC

* Default shell command
Shell commands do not play particularly nice with my zsh setup, so instead use
bash as the default shell-command explicitly.

N.B. This will need to be setup for each emacs frame as well. Otherwise it will
automatically default to your regular shell. (In my case, zsh).
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq shell-file-name "/bin/bash")
#+END_SRC
