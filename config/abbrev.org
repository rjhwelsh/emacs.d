* About
	=abbrev-mode= comes *built-in* with Emacs. Abbreviations acts as an
auto-correct for most of my typing skills. I really love it most of the time.
Though it can get annoying if you actually want to type the abbreviation; as
opposed to the long form.
* Setup
Always enable =abbrev-mode=:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default abbrev-mode t)
#+END_SRC
* Abbrev File
Define an abbreviation file.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
 (setq abbrev-file-name             ;; tell emacs where to read abbrev
        "~/.emacs.d/abbrev_defs")    ;; definitions from...
#+END_SRC

Save abbreviations automatically on logout.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq save-abbrevs t)              ;; save abbrevs when files are saved
                                     ;; you will not be asked before the abbreviations are saved
#+END_SRC
