#+TITLE: Startup configuration

* File
My initial frame opens up a file in my home-directory, every time I open a new
frame in Emacs. This file acts as a table-of-contents, or base of operations.
basically it is an *org-file* with a bunch of useful links to everything I might
want to access on a daily basis. Set this to whatever file you would prefer
below.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq rjh/startup-org-file "~/startup.org")
#+END_SRC
N.B. This startup file is different from the =startup.org= configuration file
(i.e. this file).

* Requirements
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'workgroups)
#+END_SRC

* Initial Frame
After emacs has booted I would like it to display several items on the screen
(by default).

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
	(add-hook 'after-make-frame-functions
						(lambda (&optional frame)
							(select-frame-set-input-focus frame)
							(org-agenda-list 1)
							(delete-other-windows)
							(split-window-vertically)
							(calendar)
							(diary-mark-entries)
							(other-window 1)
							(split-window-horizontally)
							(find-file rjh/startup-org-file)
						  (wg-switch-to-index-1)
						)
	)
#+END_SRC
