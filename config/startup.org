#+TITLE: Startup configuration

* File
My initial frame opens up a file in my home-directory, every time I open a new
frame in Emacs. This file acts as a table-of-contents, or base of operations.
basically it is an *org-file* with a bunch of useful links to everything I might
want to access on a daily basis. Set this to whatever file you would prefer
below.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq rjh/startup-org-file "~/startup.org")
#+END_SRC
N.B. This startup file is different from the =startup.org= configuration file
(i.e. this file).

* Requirements
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'workgroups)
#+END_SRC

* Initial Frame
After emacs has booted I would like it to display several items on the screen
(by default).

Open up some buffers.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
; Initialize some buffers
(find-file rjh/startup-org-file)
(rjh/two-week-view)
(org-agenda-list 0)

#+END_SRC


Switch to 1st workspace by default.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE emacs-lisp
	(add-hook 'after-make-frame-functions
						(lambda (&optional frame)
						)
	)
#+END_EXAMPLE
