* What is this?
This a blanked version of my own personal configuration for Emacs. If you would
like to try it out, simply clone this repo into your default =~/.emacs.d/=
directory. Please see dependencies below.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/rjhwelsh/emacs.d ~/.emacs.d
#+END_SRC

* Dependencies
You will have to manually install these packages in order to be able to use my
configuration. Please see the list below.

 * [[https://github.com/hrs][Harry R. Schwartz's]] , [[https://github.com/hrs/sensible-defaults.el][sensible-defaults.el]].

* Usage notes
 * =Magit= _will fail_ if git is not installed. If you do not want to use this
   package, you may want to comment it out in configuration.org.
