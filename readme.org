#+TITLE: Emacs configuration
#+AUTHOR: Roger J. H. Welsh

* What is this?
This a blanked version of my configuration files for Emacs.
 - Configuration can be selectively loaded through a customization setting.
 - Or by specifying it through an environmental variable.

* Before you start
** Emacs Version
   This configuration was tested on Emacs 27.0.
** Some configuration settings depend on 3rd party applications
   A non-exhaustive list is below.
   This should be noted in the configuration org file.
   Feel free to browse around (it should work in your web-browser).
   Some examples, include sensible-defaults, zetteldeft, org-gantt and jdee-server.

* Installation
To install the emacs.d setup, you will need to do the following.
These instructions, assume you will clone the repo to =~/emacs.d= .
*You can clone directly to your .emacs.d directory, but this is not recommended.*

** Quick install on Linux
Clone the repository to your desired location and run =./setup.sh=.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
	export LOCALREPO=~/emacs.d
	git clone https://github.com/rjhwelsh/emacs.d $LOCALREPO &&
		cd $LOCALREPO &&
		./setup.sh -i
#+END_SRC

** Basic Linux guidelines
 Set the following locations as variables; note these *will* be different on
 Windows.
 #+BEGIN_SRC sh
 export LOCALREPO=~/emacs.d
 export CONFIGDIR=~/.emacs.d
 #+END_SRC

 Clone my repository.
 #+BEGIN_SRC sh
 git clone https://github.com/rjhwelsh/emacs.d $LOCALREPO
 #+END_SRC

 Create the .emacs.d config directory (if it does not exist).
 #+BEGIN_SRC sh
 mkdir -vp $CONFIGDIR
 #+END_SRC

 Copy over essential configuration options, and create base directories for
 (some) modules.
 #+BEGIN_SRC sh
 cp -v $LOCALREPO/{init.el,configuration.org,personal.org,workgroups,agenda-files} $CONFIGDIR
 mkdir -vp $CONFIGDIR/{org,snippets}
 #+END_SRC

** personal.org - Required config
*** rjh/load-config-repo
	Make sure that =personal.org= in the =$CONFIGDIR= uses the correct
	load-config-repo; i.e. the location of your =$LOCALREPO=.

	Open this in your second-favourite editor and fix "~/emacs.d" to be the same as
	your $CONFIGDIR.
	#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE file:
	(setq rjh/local-config-repo "~/emacs.d") ; Set to $CONFIGDIR
	#+END_EXAMPLE

*** hrs/default-font
	You will also need to select a font.
	I like to use Hermit, but it is not all that common.
	Change "Hermit" to your preferred system font. (Like "DejaVuSans", or "Inconsolata")

	#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE file:personal.org
	(setq hrs/default-font "Hermit")
	#+END_EXAMPLE

	After setting up any additional dependencies from below, starting up emacs will
	automatically download and install packages from melpa according to the default
	configuration.

* Configuration

** configuration.org
 The [[file:configuration.org][configuration.org]] in your .emacs.d (emacs config) directory, acts as the
 centre of operations for adjusting your configuration.

 If you find anything you dislike, you can comment it out with =;=.
 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE emacs-lisp
	; (use-package evil
	; 	:ensure t)
	(use-package good
	    :ensure t)
 #+END_EXAMPLE

 Large configurations are separated into other org-files that you may load using
 the =rjh/load-config= function. Here =org.org= is my configuration for
 =org-mode=. =org-mode-plus-contrib= is a prerequisite that is built into the
 =init.el= file, before =init.el= calls =configuration.org=.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
	(rjh/load-config "org.org")
#+END_SRC

 The main goal of this project is to provide documented configuration, to quickly
 get a newbie to Emacs up and running quickly.

** personal.org
Use [[file:personal.org][personal.org]] in your .emacs.d (emacs config) directory for all your
personal configuration. Personal configuration, is anything you might want to
keep private and separate from the rest of your config.

I created this so that I could share the joys of my config file, without being
loose with my own personal details. It also serves well as a config file for
matters of personal taste (Chrome, Firefox, IE, for example).

The file is mostly self-explanatory. use it to setup variables describing:
 1. Your name
 2. email address
 3. Calendar location
 4. Contact Information
 5. Default font
 6. Default web-browser
 7. Anything else you wouldn't want to necessarily share.

* Updating
	To update configuration modules from my repo, use a git pull.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE sh
cd $LOCALREPO
git pull
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Extra notes
 * If git is not installed on your system, you may get some errors when you
   start-up; comment out the =git= module in =configuration.org= to fix.
* Further Reading
The emacs tutorial and info pages are a useful resource.
 =C-h t= and =C-h i= respectively.

The following emacs configurations, provided inspiration, and useful content.
